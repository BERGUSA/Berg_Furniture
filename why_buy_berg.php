                    <h2>Why Buy Berg?</h2>

                            <br />

                            <p>Since 1984 Berg has been designing and producing innovative children's furniture. 
                            	Throughout the years many of the designs, styles, and collections have changed but the 
                            	heart behind the products remained the same. We know that the environment around us is affecting our 
                            	lives. We know that a growing child will develop into a better person, if he or she will be surrounded 
                            	by loving people and a supportive environment. Many of our products are designed in light of that concept!
                            	<br />

                            <p>When Dr. Margaret and King Jamie O'Boyle witnessed kids making a beeline for some Berg 
                            	Furniture bedroom sets on display in a Houston-based store, they got interested. Their 
                            	curiosity was professional, since both work for the Center for Cultural Studies and Analysis,
                            	 a Philadelphia organization that does research on consumer behavior.

                            <p>Buying USA made products strengthen America as a nation. It keeps Americans productive 
                            	so they can contribute to the society and constantly invigorate the economy. Working 
                            	people pay taxes, contribute to the social security system and help sustain a supporting 
                            	budget for the children and the elderly. It is a vital part of being independent.

                            <p>Berg's Furniture is made of a selection of products such as Particle Board and Plywood 
                            	with beautiful yet resilient lamination. The durable melamine is not only attractive, but it 
                            	is also a non-allergic material, scratch resistant and easy to clean. 
								The quality metal hardware is guaranteed for life.

                            <p>"My daughters, ages 4 and 6, love their new bunk beds. They picked them out and couldn't 
                            	wait to get them. Our favorite feature is the stairs instead of a ladder. I especially like 
                            	the drawers in the stairs and the drawer under the double bed. It saved us from buying 
                            	another piece of furniture!"
