                            <p>Since 1984 Berg has been designing and producing innovative children's furniture. 
                            	Throughout the years many of the designs, styles, and collections have changed but the 
                            	heart behind the products remained the same. We know that the environment around us is 
                            	affecting our lives. We know that a growing child will develop into a better person, if he 
                            	or she will be surrounded by loving people and a supportive environment. Many of our 
                            	products are designed in light of that concept!
							</p>
							<b>We call it Smart Bedroom Systems.</b>
							<p>
							We manufacture products that make children feel excited and happy. We design bedrooms that 
							help children be organized, make them feel cozy and provide them with a place to socialize 
							with friends and family. Our products encourage creativity and curiosity, this is the true 
							value that every parent is looking for when they buy products for their kids. When making the 
							kids happy, we are making the parents happy. This is not theory, but fact. We at Berg are 
							confident that our products will provide your children with a great environment in which to 
							grow-up and develop.
