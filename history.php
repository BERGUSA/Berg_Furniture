                    <h2>History</h2>
                            <p>
                               <strong>BERG FURNITURE</strong>, family owned and operated was established in 1984. Its first furniture 	
                               line, the Rainbow Collection, was modern, sleek and modular and was sold at an 
                               affordable price. The original sales market was in the New York metropolitan area. 
                               Within a short period of time, the innovative style caught on and consumers and retail 
                               stores alike embraced the collection. The sales market began to grow and the company 
                               expanded. More furniture lines were added, as well as distribution facilities in Florida 
                               and Illinois.
                            </p>

                                In 1990 Berg Furniture outgrew its location in Passaic, NJ and moved to a new facility in 
                                Hillside, NJ. By that time, Berg Furniture had diversified into the adult furniture market
                              	and expanded production.
                            </p>

                                In 1995 a decision was made to concentrate and specialize in children's furniture and drop 
                                all other projects. New and interesting products were created. Space-saving items were 
                                introduced and new color programs initiated. As was the case from the beginning, the e
                                mphasis on new items is quality, practicality, functionality, color options and diversity 
                                of materials.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Today, Berg Furniture sells to specialty stores, as well as furniture stores, all over 
                                the world offering a wide variety of furniture for kids and teens. Our collections are 
                                innovative, fresh, colorful, exciting, and always at moderate prices.
                            </p>

                                Due to continuous growth, the company outgrew its facility in Hillside. In June 2004, 
                                Berg Furniture relocated to its present location in Barrington, N.J. "Kids are Special, make 
                                their rooms special too!" became the motto of the company.
