	<h2>Berg's Signature Staircase</h2>
	<p>This innovative staircase, designed by the president of Berg Furniture, offers a creative new twist on the traditional ladder. The non-slip treads, wide and roomy steps, and comfortable handrail provide safe and easy access to the top bunk. Each step is equipped with an extra deep drawer to maximize storage capacity. The stairs are sturdy enough for parents to use too! Need to make the bed or just read your child a bed-time story? No Problem! Stairs can be installed on either the left or right side of the system.</p>
	<p>Kids are special, make their room special too!</p>
