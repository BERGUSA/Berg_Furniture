                    <h2>Made in USA</h2>
                     
                     <p>Buying USA made products strengthens America as a nation. It keeps Americans productive 
                     	so they can contribute to society and constantly invigorate the economy. Working people pay taxes, 
                     	contribute to the social security system and help sustain a supporting budget for the children 
                     	and the elderly. It is a vital part of being independent.
					</p>
					<p>
					American products are manufactured to meet a code of standards. This complex set of rules is a result 
					of many years of experience and a long process of trial and error. These regulations, which have been 
					developed with American producers, are a benefit to the public. They are designed to keep the consumer 
					safe and provide the high level of quality that everyone expects.
					</p>
					<p>
					American manufacturers are living within the society and understand the needs and requirements of the 
					American consumer. They listen to concerns of the actual people that use their products. Producing 
					products for your community makes you accountable and responsible, thus raising the quality and 
					improving the service.
					</p>
